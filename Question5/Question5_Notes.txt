This first pass took me an evening and most of a morning to do
 - Not including setting up the server & client

I don't know if it's just the files I could find, but the small tornado
  wasn't available as a default texture, and I had to use an editor
  that I found at https://github.com/Arch-Mina/Assets-Editor, during
  which time, I realized that the texture of the smaller tornado was
  technically included in the bigger one, just never rendering.
So, through the asset editor I ended up making a custom texture (index 81)
  that utilized the graphics for the small tornado. Somehow, during that edit
  I think I broke the big tonado and didn't realize it until much later...
  Which caused much frustration on my part. Because I broke the old one and
  couldn't tell why, I ended up just making a new version of the big tornado
  at index 82, which is why this code doesn't use any default texture indexes

I kept running into problems when I tried to use Combat objects, but looking back
  I'm not sure if those were because of my broken sprite files, or if it was
  because I was doing something wrong. But, once I got something working, I decided
  I wanted to just get a first pass done on this question and get other things done
  before I come back and try making it use Combat objects again.

To determine the timing, I opened the file up in my video editor and stepped 
  frame-by-frame to determine as close to exact timings as I could find for
  replicating the video.

Between me probably causing my own problems and the difficult to use documentation.
  This probably has been one of the hardest questions on a technical test I've taken,
  That being said, I've found even less documentation to help with Question 6, so that'll
  probably take the cake once I get to it.
