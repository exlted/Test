Question 7 went much better for me than Question 5 did.
 It took about 4 hours before code cleanup & commenting to get it working

However, I feel like once again I had to walk "outside" of what might have
 been intended, as I couldn't find an existing event to hook into, so I
 added a new event in the main loop, providing the delta between each frame

The UI itself was fairly straightforward besides that though.

There's a slight issue that I might come back and work on with the button
 being able to go over the top bar of the window, I'm probably not pulling
 the right Rect from the window for determining the position is all.
